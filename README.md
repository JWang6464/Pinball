# Pinball
A Python-based Pinball simulation that models the physics and behavior of a pinball machine using object-oriented programming. This project includes modules for handling ball collisions, graphical rendering, and physics calculations. Core files include collision.py, graphicsPlus.py, and physics_objects.py.

This repository contains a Python-based Pinball simulation that models the physics and behavior of a pinball machine. The simulation uses object-oriented programming to handle various aspects like ball collisions, physics calculations, and graphical rendering.

Ball Collisions: Handles realistic collisions between the ball and objects using the collision.py module.
Physics Simulation: Simulates forces such as gravity and collision dynamics using physics_objects.py.
Graphical Rendering: Visualizes the pinball machine and ball movement using graphicsPlus.py for graphical components.

collision.py: Handles the logic for ball collisions with objects in the pinball machine.
graphicsPlus.py: Manages graphical rendering for the pinball simulation.
physics_objects.py: Contains the physics objects (e.g., ball, bumpers) and defines how they interact with the environment.
test_ballclass.py: Includes test cases for the ball class, ensuring correct behavior in the simulation.
wordmap.py: Likely handles additional visual or object-related data for the pinball simulation.
